# cdenv
cdenv (C Dotenv) is a small utility for getting the value of a variable from
.env files.

```shell
cdenv [-f <dotenv>] <variable>
```

cdenv will attempt to read from a file named .env by default, this can be
overriden with the -f option.

There are many features missing, these will be added as I run issues.
